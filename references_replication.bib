  abstract  = "Abstract This paper presents genetic matching, a method of
               multivariate matching that uses an evolutionary search algorithm
               to determine the weight each covariate is given. Both propensity
               score matching and matching based on Mahalanobis distance are
               limiting cases of this method. The algorithm makes transparent
               certain issues that all matching methods must confront. We
               present simulation studies that show that the algorithm improves
               covariate balance and that it may reduce bias if the selection
               on observables assumption holds. We then present a reanalysis of
               a number of data sets in the LaLonde (1986) controversy.",

  abstract  = "[We describe a new computer program that combines evolutionary
               algorithm methods with a derivative-based, quasi-Newton method
               to solve difficult unconstrained optimization problems. The
               program, called GENOUD (GENetic Optimization Using Derivatives),
               effectively solves problems that are nonlinear or perhaps even
               discontinuous in the parameters of the function to be optimized.
               When a statistical model's estimating function (for example, a
               log-likelihood) is nonlinear in the model's parameters, the
               function to be optimized will usually not be globally concave
               and may contain irregularities such as saddlepoints or
               discontinuous jumps. Optimization methods that rely on
               derivatives of the objective function may be unable to find any
               optimum at all. Or multiple local optima may exist, so that
               there is no guarantee that a derivative-based method will
               converge to the global optimum. We discuss the theoretical basis
               for expecting GENOUD to have a high probability of finding
               global optima. We conduct Monte Carlo experiments using scalar
               Normal mixture densities to illustrate this capability. We also
               use a system of four simultaneous nonlinear equations that has
               many parameters and multiple local optima to compare the
               performance of GENOUD to that of the Gauss-Newton algorithm in
               SAS's PROC MODEL.]",
